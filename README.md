# sudokuSolver-js

Repository dedicated for the configuration and development of a Sudoku Solver based on JavaScript, by using solution methods like a human would solve it, so to be able to solve each sudoku puzzle like a tutorial, no backtracking algorith.

## Change Control and Versioning

### Version 0.2.5a (Branch optimizeDiscards) 2022-09-27

- For the 3 Discard obviousPairs Techniques, the first two loops, where the current status is gathered, were consolidated in just 1 function for a general block (row, column or square) called discardingFunctions.gettingDetailedInfo.
- Several other name optimizations for variables to follow bem naming scheme and for the file names.
- Based on the optimization for the 3 obviousPairs discarding techniques, a new technique is being added, which finds the locked candidates (only row for now), this release shows in console the result, next release will discard the corresponding candidates/notes from the Matrix and expand to column and square.

---

### Version 0.2.5 (HTML Found Values Format) 2022-09-26

- Light formatting to the Found Values section in the HTML (New article created for each step solved)
- ID given for each step in the Found Values Section, to be used with the tutorial component to be implemented in future releases.

---

### Version 0.2.4 (2 Main Features) 2022-09-26

- The format for loading the sudoku values from file, was standardized with the one used for the manual method
- The discardedvalue function now consolidates the code for the 3 blocks (row, column and square) when a couple of candidates can be discarded by ObviousPairs process. It probably will be used for hiddenPairs in a future release as well

---

### Version 0.2.3 (Bug Fix) 2022-09-24

- Bug introduced by previous feature added has been fixed
- The functionality to go back one step had stopped working by adding the feature to manually load the sudoku values. To fix it, now the update of values when using going back one step function uses this method: "document.querySelector(".row" + itemrow + ".column" + itemcolumn + " input").value" instead of modifying the attribute
- A new Alert has been added in those cases when the Sudoku cannot be solved yet.

---

### Version 0.2.2 (Manual Sudoku ingress) 2022-09-24

### Version 0.1.9a (Branch convertMatrixes Matrix Variables) 2022-09-23

- theMatrix and stepsDetail variables moved to globalVar.js file
- Solving Techniques Functions moved to solvingTechniques.js file
- discarding functions were moved to a new file (discradingTechniques.js)
- With the changes made since v0.1.1 (when the javascript was contained in just one file) main.js file was reduced from more than 900 lines to 146 lines, and disagragated in several lines for organization and code cleanliness.

---

### Version 0.1.9 (Variable areNotesShowing) 2022-09-22

---

### Version 0.1.7 (Global Variables globalVar.js) 2022-09-16

- globalVar.js is added to host several real global variables, with this, the process of migrating functions to other files will be easier and cleaner.

---

### Version 0.1.6 (solvingProcessFunctions.js file) 2022-09-16

- The functions cellValueFound and newfoundvalueHTML were taken out to a new file solvingProcessFunctions.js

---

### Version 0.1.5a (fixing Naming files Bug) 2022-09-16

- The files where a letter went from lowercase to uppercase, were not changed in github, so the links broke. The situation is fixed with this commit changing the names of couple of files.

---

### Version 0.1.5 (bem naming) 2022-09-16

- The functions in separated files renamed to bem convention

---

### Version 0.1.4 (matrixFunctions to separate js file) 2022-09-10

- The functions related to the whole Matrix like create, load, validate, have been taken out to a different js file (theMatrixFunctions.js)
- there were several parts where the JSON methods for arrays were used several times, they were reduce to just one time, to avoid unnecesary CPU cycles.

---

### Version 0.1.3 (Taking functions to js files) 2022-09-09

- functions showNotes and hideNotes were taken from main.js to recurrentFunctions.js
- new js file created (optionszero.js) where the functions noteZeroRow, noteZeroColumn and noteZeroSquare were taken from main.js to this disagregated file

---

### Version 0.1.2 (type="module" changes) 2022-09-08

- type="module" added to the script, so it can split in several js files
- two recurrent minor functions (defineSquareCoordinatesRC and defineSquareCoordinatesSQ) were taken out to an external js file for testing purposes.
- the data to pre-load the sudoku game is now taken from data.js file
  script.js renamed to main.js

---

### Version 0.1.1 (Minor Style Changes) 2022-09-07

- Small changes to make it more responsive

- Adjusted configuration to decrease the number of steps and resolvedcells according to the new capability og going back to previous steps
- Correction of theMatrix previous steps (it was being referenced instead of cloned, so any change in the latest state was replicated to all other previous steps in the Matrix (time dimension)), now with the use of JSON methods (parse and stringfy), each of the steps in time of the Matrix is isolated and can be modified.
- overflow-y scroll added to avoid the jump in size ehen the ammount of steps documented in the HTML made the width of the screen to change
- Several changes in style and breakpoints added to change font sizes.

---

### Version 0.0.3 (Functions and Scope) 2022-09-01
