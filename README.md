# sudokuSolver-js

Repository dedicated for the configuration and development of a Sudoku Solver based on JavaScript, which functioning version is located at [LeonardoGonzalez's Sudoku Solver](https://lglegob.github.io/sudokuSolver-js/). It is being created by using logical solution methods like a human would solve it. This with the purpose to be able to solve each sudoku puzzle that a user ingress, like a tutorial, with step and step explanations and methods definitions. No brute Force algorithm. No backtracking algorithm.

Also, this same bug could cause the 3 cells to be detected in the same square, being the second Pincer in the same row. The issue is solved bu setting a couple more of if statements checking that for the first Pincer, it must not be located in the same row or column of the Pivot, and the when looking for the second Pincer (Square-row or Square-Column), it is now checked, it is not located in the same square as the Pivot and Pincer1.

---

### Version 0.2.3 (Bug Fix) 2022-09-24

- Bug introduced by previous feature added has been fixed
- The functionality to go back one step had stopped working by adding the feature to manually load the sudoku values.
